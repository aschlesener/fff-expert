# FFF Expert

### A Chrome extension that makes sure you don't miss out on the best add-ons for your favorite subscription box.

## Intro
Ever go to the FabFitFun add-on store, only to find that the best items are disappearing from stock right before your eyes? Get ahead of the pack by using this Chrome extension to automatically add all the low-stock items to your cart! No more manually clicking each item, scrolling through pages, and hoping the item you want doesn't sell out before you get to it.
 

## Installing
### From the Chrome store
Coming soon!

### Locally
1. Download this repo to your computer.
2. Go to your Chrome extensions page by entering `chrome://extensions/` in a new tab. 
3. Toggle "Developer Mode" on.
4. Click "Load unpacked" and select this repo from your download in step 1.
5. You should now see the "FFF Expert" extension installed.

## Using
This extension will automatically activate when you're on the FFF add-ons page, https://fabfitfun.com/add-ons/. 

By default, the extension will force the page to scroll to the bottom in order to load all the products. Give it a minute; FFF's site is finicky.

Once the page is done scrolling, click on the FFF Expert extension icon in your browser. You'll see three buttons - go ahead and click the first one to add all the low-stock items to your cart.

### Adding items

Now that the items are reserved in your cart, take a look at them and remove the ones you don't want. **Remember, at the end of the FFF add-on period, you pay for all the items in your cart.** Don't forget to remove the ones you don't want to order!

### Removing items
You can also click the second button as a quick shortcut to remove all items in your cart. 

### Scrolling
The third add-on button will automatically scroll the bottom of the add-on page. This button is useful if you've turned auto-scrolling off in the FFF Expert extension (see below).

## Settings
 (Coming soon) Is the scroll feature acting up? You can choose to scroll the page yourself by turning scroll off in the extension settings.
